# Image Processing Concepts Implemented in Python

This GitHub repository contains a collection of image processing techniques implemented in Python, including Histogram Equalization, Spatial Filtering, Bit-plane Slicing, and Intensity Transformation.

Image processing is a crucial area in computer science that deals with the manipulation of digital images using mathematical algorithms. This repository contains Python implementations of various image processing techniques that can be used to enhance the quality of digital images.

### Installation
To use the techniques implemented in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the following Python packages:

* NumPy
* OpenCV
* Matplotlib

### Techniques Implemented
This repository contains implementations of the following image processing techniques:

* Histogram Equalization: A technique that enhances the contrast of an image by adjusting the image's intensity distribution.
* Spatial Filtering: A technique that applies a filter mask to an image to remove noise and enhance image features.
* Bit-plane Slicing: A technique that extracts specific bits of an image's pixel values to reveal hidden image features.
* Intensity Transformation: A technique that adjusts the intensity levels of an image to enhance its visual appearance.
